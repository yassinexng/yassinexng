**Computer Science Engineering Student** | Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast

Currently pursuing my engineering degree at ENSA Kénitra after completing my DEUST at FST. I'm that person who learns by doing—reading documentation is fine, but I'd rather break things and rebuild them to actually understand how they work.

## What I Do

I work with data and machine learning, but not in the "just call scikit-learn and hope for the best" way. I implement algorithms from scratch first to understand the math, then use proper libraries for production. Started with C to understand memory and pointers, moved to Java for OOP patterns, and now mostly work in Python and R for data work.

My approach: understand the theory, implement it manually, then use the right tools to scale it.

## Projects I've Built

### [Student Performance Predictor](https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor)
Built a regression pipeline to predict student GPAs based on study habits and behavior patterns. Used real CSV data, implemented custom gradient descent logic with NumPy before switching to scikit-learn for the final model. Includes full data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and visualizations with Matplotlib.

**Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### [Quantum-Inspired Linear Regression](https://github.com/yassinexng/quantum-inspired-linear-regression)
An experimental Java project that applies quantum mechanics concepts (superposition, tunneling) to optimization algorithms. The idea was to see if quantum-inspired heuristics could help escape local minima better than standard gradient descent. Pure experimentation—modular architecture with clean interfaces for different quantum states and objective functions.

**Stack:** Java, OOP, Optimization Theory

### [Logistic Regression From Scratch](https://github.com/yassinexng/logistic-regression-churn-from-scratch)
Complete implementation of logistic regression without using high-level ML libraries. Built for customer churn prediction. Coded the sigmoid function, MLE, and gradient descent manually to prove I actually understand what's happening under the hood. Got comparable accuracy to standard libraries, which was the whole point.

**Stack:** Python, NumPy, Mathematical Optimization

### [GDG Data Project](https://github.com/yassinexng/data_project_GDG)
Collaborative data analysis project I worked on with [YounesPRY](https://github.com/YounesPRY). Real teamwork experience dealing with merge conflicts, different coding styles, and shared problem-solving.

**Stack:** Python, Data Analysis

## Tech I Use

**Languages:** Python, Java, C, R, SQL/PL-SQL  
**Data Science:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Streamlit  
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Linux, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks

I pick tools based on what actually makes sense for the problem, not what's trendy.

Fluent in Arabic, French, and English—useful when you're reading research papers in multiple languages or collaborating with different teams.
