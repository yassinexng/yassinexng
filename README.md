# Yassine Mouadi

Computer Science Engineering Student | Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast

Currently pursuing my engineering degree at ENSA Kénitra after completing my DEUST at FST. I learn by doing—reading documentation is fine, but I prefer breaking things and rebuilding them to truly understand how they work.

## What I Do

I work with data and machine learning, but not in the "just call scikit-learn and hope for the best" way. I implement algorithms from scratch first to understand the math, then use proper libraries for production. Started with C to understand memory and pointers, moved to Java for OOP patterns, and now mostly work in Python and R for data work.

My approach: understand the theory, implement it manually, then use the right tools to scale it.

## Projects I've Built

### [DocuMind](https://github.com/yassinexng/documind)

Built a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows semantic search and question-answering over personal documents. Frontend is developed with React and TypeScript, backend uses FastAPI for concurrent processing. Documents are chunked into 500-character windows and converted into 384-dimensional embeddings via sentence-transformers, stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient similarity search. Queries are embedded and compared using cosine distance for context-aware retrieval. Includes a technical report in LaTeX detailing the architecture and implementation.

Stack: Python, FastAPI, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Docker, Docker Compose, Sentence Transformers, Google Gemini API

### [Student Performance Predictor](https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor)

Built a regression pipeline to predict student GPAs based on study habits and behavior patterns. Used real CSV data, implemented custom gradient descent logic with NumPy before switching to scikit-learn for the final model. Includes full data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and visualizations with Matplotlib.

Stack: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### [Quantum-Inspired Linear Regression](https://github.com/yassinexng/quantum-inspired-linear-regression)

An experimental Java project that applies quantum mechanics concepts (superposition, tunneling) to optimization algorithms. The goal was to see if quantum-inspired heuristics could escape local minima better than standard gradient descent. Modular architecture with clean interfaces for different quantum states and objective functions.

Stack: Java, OOP, Optimization Theory

### [Logistic Regression From Scratch](https://github.com/yassinexng/logistic-regression-churn-from-scratch)

Complete implementation of logistic regression without high-level ML libraries, for customer churn prediction. Built sigmoid, MLE, and gradient descent manually, achieving comparable accuracy to standard libraries.

Stack: Python, NumPy, Mathematical Optimization

### [GDG Data Project](https://github.com/yassinexng/data_project_GDG)

Collaborative data analysis project with [YounesPRY](https://github.com/YounesPRY). Gained experience in teamwork, merge conflicts, different coding styles, and shared problem-solving.

Stack: Python, Data Analysis

## Tech I Use

Languages: Python, Java, C, R, SQL/PL-SQL
Data Science & Machine Learning: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Sentence Transformers, embeddings, vector search
Web & Full-Stack: React, TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Docker, Docker Compose
Tools: Git/GitHub, Linux, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks

I pick tools based on what actually makes sense for the problem, not what's trendy.

Fluent in Arabic, French, and English—useful when reading research papers in multiple languages or collaborating with international teams.
