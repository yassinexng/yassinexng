## 🧭 About Me

I'm a motivated **Computer Science student** who enjoys building real, working projects — from algorithms and data pipelines to experimental systems. I started with low-level C, moved into Python and Java, and now I’m exploring everything from machine learning to quantum-inspired logic, while staying open to full-stack, systems, and network development.

## 🧪 Projects

### 🎓 [Student Performance Predictor](https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor)
A Python project that predicts student GPA using a linear regression model built with **NumPy** and **scikit-learn**.

- Real-world CSV processing and visualization  
- Includes both custom-built logic and scikit-learn models  
- Full notebook with clean pipeline, model evaluation, and insights

### 🌌 [Quantum-Inspired Linear Regression](https://github.com/yassinexng/quantum-inspired-linear-regression)
An experimental Java framework that uses quantum mechanics concepts like **superposition** and **tunneling** for optimization.

- Modular design with interfaces (`QuantumState`, `ObjectiveFunction`)  
- Implements sampling and tunneling logic for escaping local minima  
- A creative blend of computer science theory and hands-on design patterns
